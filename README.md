# Raise Effect Prototypes

This is a basic prototype for the Raise Effect app created with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

## Setup

Clone this repo and navigate to the new directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/Jobs-Economy/prototypes.git
cd prototypes/
```

Open up `index.html` and your browser and you're all set.

## Development

Make sure you [have Node.js installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node), then run `npm install` in the project directory.

Run `gulp`, which will start a task to watch for changes to `style.sass` and compile that to `style.css`.

Make your changes in a feature branch, then submit a pull request.

## Live Site

The prototypes are hosted through Github pages and available here: [http://jobs-economy.github.io/prototypes/](http://jobs-economy.github.io/prototypes/).
